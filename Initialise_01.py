Initialise
Initialisation module

Functions:
	+ Generate_Lookup
		@ It opens a specific availability raster.
		@ Then, by running through it, identifies sites which are developable.
        @ These are saved into a lookup list, which is saved as txt and returned.
	+ Generate_ClinicsPlan
		@ Function creates a Clinics_Plan based the availability Lookup.
		@ It generates a solution with a random number of Clinics
		@ between 1 and Clinics_Max
	+ Generate_Proposed_Sites
		@ Function that takes a Clinics plan as an input and returns
		@ a list of the coordinates of the proposed sites
